    To cover
    - CSS has a LOT of units you can ignore almost all of them.

    - Units break down in relative and non-relative units
      - relative unis are based off something else
      - absolute units are constant

    - Absolute units you care about:
      - px "the OG"

    - Relative units you care about:
      - em: font size of the parent. useful for like relative sizing like an annotation
      - rem: font size of the document.
      - %: also based on the parent
      - vh: Height of the viewport
      - vw: Width of the viewport

    - There are also unitless things and colors like
      - opacity: 0.5;
      - line-height: 1.4;
      - color: #bada55;
