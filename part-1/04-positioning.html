    To cover
    - Position allows you to change somethings position without
      changing the order of your html or the specific flow.

    - There are 4 kinds of positioning you mostly care about:

    - "static"
      - The default, this is where it would have been anyways
      - top, left, etc. have no effect

    - "relative"
      - Starting point is where it would be anyways
      - top, left etc. offset it without effecting other elements

    - "absolute"
      - element is removed from page flow
      - top, left etc. based on the next relative parent

    - "fixed"
      - element is removed from page flow
      - top, left etc. based on the viewport

    Fun fact:
     - if you specify both left + right the direction of your document will win.
       e.g. in a left-to-right language left will win.
