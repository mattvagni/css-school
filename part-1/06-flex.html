    To cover

    - To be productive with flexbox 99% of the time you need
      the following properties:

    - On the parent with display: flex;

      - flex-direction
        - is it left to right, top to bottom, right to left etc.
        - default is left to right also called "row"

      - justify-content
        - determiinses how children are distributed across the
          so called 'main' direction of the flex container
        - Also used for grid stuff so docs are confusing

      - align-items
        - determins how childre are distributed across the other axis
          of the flex container.

    - On the children of a parent with flex:

      - flex-grow
        - Determines how the remaining space is distributed amongst siblings
        - Default is 0
        - Demo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow

      - flex-shrink
        - Determines how elements should be shrunk down if they take two much space up
        - Default is 1
        - Demo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink

      - flex-basis
        - Basically min-width or min-height but doesn't care about the direction.
        - Only applies in the direction you are flexing
        - Demo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis

    - There is a lot lot more to flexbox.
    - The future is grid once browser support gets there and RN supports it.
