    To cover
    - There are generally 2 kinds of boxes in css:
      - block (like paragraphs)
      - inline (like words in a paragram)

    - Block elements:
      - Will be on it's own line
      - Width and height work
      - Padding, margins and borders push other elements
      - Will generally fill the width of the parent
      - Size is determined as size + padding + border === actual size
        - This can be overriden by box-sizing

    - Inline elements:
      - Will be in the same line as other things
      - Vertical padding, margins and borders won't push other elements
      - Horizontal padding, margins and borders will push other elements

    - HTML Elements have are always either one or the other. Most are block.

    - You can change / modify this using the display property.

    - Display properties determines how something flows in the page (outside)
    - And how something's childrens are layout out (inside)

    - Outside ones
      - block
      - inline
      - inline-block

    - Outside + inside
      - flex
      - grid

    Why is this useful?
    - This is the first building block to doing any layout.

      Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
